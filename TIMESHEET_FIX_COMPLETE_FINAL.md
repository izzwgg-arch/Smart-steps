# Timesheet Time Entry Fix - Complete Implementation

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why "3:00 PM" Snapped to "12:00 AM"

**Root Cause**: The original `TimeInput` component used text inputs with a `useEffect` that synced from the `value` prop. When a user typed "3" then "00" and selected PM:

1. User types "3" → component updates hour state
2. User types "00" → component updates minute state  
3. User selects "PM" → component calls `onChange(900)` (3:00 PM)
4. **BUT** the `useEffect` at line 56-65 would sync from the `value` prop
5. If the parent component hadn't updated yet, or if there was a race condition, the `value` prop might still be `INVALID_TIME` or an old value
6. This caused the component to reset to the old value, appearing as a "snap" to 12:00 AM

**The Fix**: Replaced text inputs with **select dropdowns** for hour, minute, and AM/PM. Select dropdowns are:
- More stable (no typing issues)
- Always have valid values
- Update parent immediately when changed
- No race conditions with useEffect syncing

### Why AM/PM Selection Was Inconsistent

**Root Cause**: The original component relied on text input parsing and pattern matching to detect AM/PM changes. This was unreliable because:
- Users could type "p" or "P" in various ways
- Pattern matching could fail on edge cases
- The `useEffect` syncing could overwrite the selection

**The Fix**: AM/PM is now a **select dropdown** - 100% reliable, no parsing needed.

### Why Default Times Didn't Update Generated Rows

**Root Cause**: The `useEffect` that generates day entries (line 247-299) had `defaultTimes` removed from dependencies to prevent regenerating all entries when defaults changed. However:
- When defaults changed AFTER entries were generated, the second `useEffect` (line 302-379) should update them
- But there was a logic issue: the first `useEffect` didn't include `defaultTimes`, so new date selections wouldn't use updated defaults
- The second `useEffect` only updated `isDefaultDerived: true` entries, which was correct

**The Fix**: 
1. Added `defaultTimes` back to the first `useEffect` dependencies so new date selections use current defaults
2. The second `useEffect` correctly updates only `isDefaultDerived: true` entries when defaults change
3. Manual edits set `isDefaultDerived: false`, preventing overwrites

### Why NaN Appeared

**Root Cause**: Invalid times (INVALID_TIME = -1) were used in calculations without proper guards:
- `calcDurationMinutes(-1, 540)` would return 0, but division could produce NaN
- Missing `isNaN()` checks before displaying values
- Missing validation before calculations

**The Fix**: 
- New `lib/time.ts` utilities **never return NaN** - they return `null` for invalid inputs
- All calculations use safe division with `isNaN()` guards
- Display code checks for NaN before rendering

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Centralized Time Utilities (`lib/time.ts`)

**Key Functions**:
- `toMinutes(hour12, minute, ampm)` → `number | null` (never NaN)
- `fromMinutes(minutes)` → `{hour12, minute2, ampm}` 
- `duration(startMins, endMins)` → `number | null` (never NaN)
- `to24Hour(minutes)` → `string` (for storage)
- `to12Hour(minutes)` → `string` (for display)
- `validateRange(start, end)` → `{valid, error?}`

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for time conversions
- Never returns NaN - always returns number or null
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Comprehensive validation

### 2. Replaced TimeInput with Stable 3-Control Version

**New Component** (`components/timesheets/TimeInput.tsx`):
- **Hour select** (1-12 dropdown)
- **Minute select** (00-59 dropdown)  
- **AM/PM select** (AM/PM dropdown)

**Key Features**:
- ✅ No text input parsing - select dropdowns are always valid
- ✅ Updates parent only when all three values are selected
- ✅ No useEffect that overwrites input while typing
- ✅ Syncs from `value` prop only when it changes externally
- ✅ Handles all times correctly (2AM, 4PM, 10PM, etc.)

### 3. Fixed Default Times Propagation

**Changes in `TimesheetForm.tsx`**:
- First `useEffect` (line 247): Generates entries when dates change, uses current `defaultTimes`
- Second `useEffect` (line 302): Updates only `isDefaultDerived: true` entries when defaults change
- Manual edits set `isDefaultDerived: false`, preventing overwrites

**How it works**:
1. User selects date range → entries generated with `isDefaultDerived: true` using current defaults
2. User changes default times → second `useEffect` updates all `isDefaultDerived: true` entries
3. User manually edits a row → `isDefaultDerived` set to `false` for that row
4. User changes defaults again → manually edited rows are NOT overwritten

### 4. Removed useEffect That Overwrites Input

**Before**: `TimeInput` had a `useEffect` that synced from `value` prop, which could overwrite user input during typing.

**After**: `TimeInput` only syncs from `value` prop when it changes externally (not from user input). Select dropdowns eliminate typing issues entirely.

### 5. Fixed Save Payload Validation

**Enhanced validation in `handleSubmit`**:
- Checks for `INVALID_TIME` before calculating duration
- Validates time range (end > start)
- Guards against NaN: `if (isNaN(minutes) || minutes <= 0 || minutes > 1440)`
- Shows clear error messages to user
- Never sends NaN to API

### 6. Added Comprehensive Tests

**Unit Tests** (`lib/__tests__/time.test.ts`):
- ✅ `toMinutes(3, "00", "PM")` returns 900
- ✅ `toMinutes(12, "00", "AM")` returns 0
- ✅ `toMinutes(2, "00", "AM")` returns 120
- ✅ `toMinutes(4, "00", "PM")` returns 960
- ✅ `toMinutes(10, "00", "PM")` returns 1320
- ✅ Invalid input returns null (never NaN)
- ✅ Round-trip conversion tests
- ✅ Duration calculation tests
- ✅ Validation tests

**Integration Tests** (`components/timesheets/__tests__/TimeInput.test.tsx`):
- ✅ Type hour=3, minute=00, select PM → UI stays 3:00 PM (no revert)
- ✅ AM/PM selection works correctly
- ✅ All times work (2AM, 4PM, 10PM, etc.)
- ✅ Component syncs from value prop correctly
- ✅ No onChange called when value is incomplete
