---

## Getting Started

### Accessing Payroll Management

1. Log in to the system as an **Admin** or user with payroll permissions
2. On the main dashboard, click the **"Payroll Management"** tile
3. You'll see the Payroll Management dashboard with 5 main sections

---

## Section 1: Import Time Logs

### Purpose
Import attendance/time logs from your fingerprint scanner (Realand device or similar) into the system.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Prepare Your File
- Export your attendance data from the fingerprint scanner as:
  - `.xls` (Excel 97-2003)
  - `.xlsx` (Excel 2007+)
  - `.csv` (Comma-separated values)

#### Step 2: Upload File
1. Go to **Payroll Management** → **Import Time Logs**
2. Click **"Select File"** and choose your exported file
3. Wait for the preview to load (shows first 100 rows)

#### Step 3: Map Columns
The system will try to auto-detect columns, but you may need to adjust:

**Required Mappings:**
- **Employee Identifier** (required): Select the column that contains employee names or IDs
  - Common names: "NAME", "Employee Name", "USER ID", "ENROLL ID"
  
- **Timestamp OR Date + Time** (required): Choose one option:
  - **Option A**: Single "Timestamp" column (if date and time are together)
  - **Option B**: Separate "Date" column AND "Time" column

**Optional Mappings:**
- **Event Type (IN/OUT)**: Select column showing clock-in/clock-out
  - Common names: "ATT TYPE", "Event Type", "Type"
  - Values like "Clock-in", "Clock-out", "IN", "OUT" will be recognized

**Settings:**
- **Timezone**: Select your timezone (default: Eastern Time)
- **Save as Import Template**: Check this if you want to reuse these mappings later
  - Enter a template name (e.g., "Realand Scanner Export")

#### Step 4: Process Import
1. Review your column mappings
2. Click **"Process Import"**
3. The system will:
   - Check for duplicate files (prevents re-importing the same file)
   - Parse all rows
   - Create time log entries
   - Show you how many rows were imported vs skipped

#### Step 5: View Imported Logs
- After import, you'll be redirected to view the imported time logs
- You can filter by:
  - Date range
  - Employee
  - Unmatched employees (employees not yet linked to payroll employees)

### Tips for Import
- **File Format**: The system accepts various Excel formats, but `.xlsx` works best
- **Column Names**: Column names don't need to match exactly - just select the right column in the mapper
- **Deduplication**: The same file won't be imported twice (based on file hash)
- **Large Files**: Files with hundreds of rows are supported
- **Unmatched Employees**: After import, you'll need to link scanner employees to payroll employees (see Section 2)

---

## Section 2: Employee Pay Settings

### Purpose
Set up employees for payroll calculation, including pay rates, overtime rules, and other settings.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Access Employee Settings
1. Go to **Payroll Management** → **Employee Pay Settings**
2. You'll see a list of existing payroll employees (if any)

#### Step 2: Add New Employee
1. Click **"Add Employee"** or **"New Employee"**
2. Fill in the form:

**Basic Information:**
- **Display Name**: Full name as it should appear in payroll (required)
- **Scanner Code**: Optional - the employee code/ID from your scanner
  - Example: If scanner shows "103" for "Mrs. Brach", enter "103"
  - This helps auto-match imported time logs
- **Link to User Account**: Optional - link to an existing system user
  - Leave blank if this is a payroll-only employee (not a system user)
- **Active**: Check to enable this employee for payroll runs

**Pay Settings:**
- **Pay Type**: Select one:
  - **Hourly** (most common): Paid by the hour
  - **Daily**: Fixed daily rate
  - **Per Shift**: Fixed rate per shift
- **Hourly Rate**: Enter the base hourly rate (required for hourly pay)
  - Example: `25.00` for $25/hour
- **Daily Rate**: Optional - if using daily pay type
- **Per Shift Rate**: Optional - if using per-shift pay type

**Overtime Settings:**
- **Weekly OT After**: Hours before overtime kicks in (default: 40)
  - Example: `40` means overtime after 40 hours per week
- **Daily OT Enabled**: Check if you want daily overtime rules
  - (Advanced feature - typically leave unchecked)

**Other Settings:**
- **Rounding Rule**: How to round hours
  - **None**: No rounding
  - **Up**: Round up to nearest interval
  - **Down**: Round down
  - **Nearest**: Round to nearest interval
- **Break Deduction**: Check if breaks should be deducted from hours

  - Example: `15.5` for 15.5% burden

#### Step 3: Save Employee
1. Click **"Save"** or **"Create Employee"**
2. The employee will appear in your list

#### Step 4: Edit Employee
1. Click on an employee in the list
2. Make changes
3. Click **"Save"** or **"Update"**

#### Step 5: Link Unmatched Time Logs
After importing time logs, you may see "unmatched" employees:
1. Go to **Import Time Logs** → View imported logs
2. Filter by "Unmatched Employee"
3. For each unmatched employee:
   - Create a new Payroll Employee with matching scanner code
   - OR edit an existing employee and add the scanner code
   - The system will automatically link future imports

### Tips for Employee Setup
- **Scanner Code Matching**: If your scanner uses employee IDs (like "103"), enter that exact code in the "Scanner Code" field
- **Multiple Rates**: Currently, one rate per employee is supported. For multiple rates by role, you can create separate employee records or use allocations (see Section 5)
- **Inactive Employees**: Uncheck "Active" to exclude employees from new payroll runs (keeps historical data)

## Troubleshooting

### Import Issues
- **"File already imported"**: The same file was imported before. Use a different file or check existing imports.
- **"No employee column found"**: Make sure you mapped the Employee Identifier column correctly.
- **"Invalid date/time"**: Check your Date and Time column mappings. Ensure dates are in a standard format.

### Calculation Issues
- **Hours seem wrong**: Check time log imports for the date range. Verify employee pay rates are correct.
- **Overtime not calculating**: Check "Weekly OT After" setting (should be 40 for standard overtime).

### Employee Matching Issues
- **Unmatched employees**: Add the scanner code to the payroll employee record to auto-match future imports.
