# Timesheet Rebuild - Deployment Summary

## ✅ ALL CHANGES COMPLETE

### Core Fixes Implemented

1. **Time Input System (REBUILT)**
   - Custom controlled `TimeFieldAMPM` component
   - Accepts ANY valid time (1:00, 2:15, 3:25, etc.)
   - Auto-inserts colon after numeric entry
   - Dedicated AM/PM toggle next to every time input
   - No auto-jumping, no forced conversions, no snapping
   - Stores time as structured fields: `{ hour, minute, meridiem }`

2. **Default Times → Day Row Sync (WORKING)**
   - Default DR times automatically apply to DR day rows
   - Default SV times automatically apply to SV day rows
   - Manual edits override defaults (tracked via `touched` flags)
   - Updates occur immediately and reliably

3. **Checkbox Fixes (COMPLETE)**
   - Added "Use" checkbox for DR (matches SV behavior)
   - Both DR and SV checkboxes behave identically

4. **Removed Features (COMPLETE)**
   - ❌ Rounding logic removed entirely
   - ❌ Units column removed from bottom section
   - ❌ Overnight rows removed (DR and SV)
   - ❌ Day labels removed from bottom table
   - ❌ Timesheet ID removed from print/export output

5. **Overlap Prevention (ENFORCED)**
   - **Frontend**: Highlights conflicting rows and time fields in red
   - **Frontend**: Displays human-readable conflict messages
   - **Frontend**: Disables Save button when conflicts exist
   - **Frontend**: Scrolls to first conflict automatically
   - **Backend**: Server-side validation in POST and PUT routes
   - **Backend**: Returns structured error data with conflict details
   - **Rules**: Prevents overlaps for same Provider/Client/Timesheet, DR vs DR, SV vs SV, DR vs SV

6. **Data Storage (CORRECT)**
   - Time stored as structured `TimeAMPM` objects
   - Converted to 24-hour format only for database storage
   - No rounded or derived values stored
   - Units calculated as `minutes / 15` (no rounding)

7. **Export & Print (IMPLEMENTED)**
   - ✅ Print functionality (via `TimesheetPrintPreview`)
   - ✅ Export to Excel (.xlsx)
   - ✅ Export to CSV
   - ✅ Timesheet ID removed from all exports
   - ✅ Overnight column removed from exports
   - ✅ Readable AM/PM formatting in exports

8. **Automated Invoicing (SCHEDULED)**
   - ✅ Runs every Tuesday at 7:00 AM (server time)
   - ✅ Generates invoices based on approved timesheets
   - ✅ Uses insurance rate per unit (1 unit = 15 minutes)
   - ✅ No rounding applied to units

## Files Modified

### Core Components
- `components/timesheets/TimeFieldAMPM.tsx` - REBUILT from scratch
- `components/timesheets/TimesheetForm.tsx` - Major refactor
- `components/timesheets/TimesheetsList.tsx` - Export updates
- `components/timesheets/TimesheetPrintPreview.tsx` - Timesheet ID removed

### Utilities
- `lib/timesheetUtils.ts` - Removed rounding and overnight logic
- `lib/timesheetOverlapUtils.ts` - NEW FILE for overlap detection
- `lib/exportUtils.ts` - Removed Timesheet ID and Overnight columns
- `lib/jobs/invoiceGeneration.ts` - Removed rounding logic
- `lib/server/timesheetOverlapValidation.ts` - NEW FILE for backend validation

### API Routes
- `app/api/timesheets/route.ts` - Backend overlap validation added
- `app/api/timesheets/[id]/route.ts` - Backend overlap validation added

## Build Status

✅ **Build completed successfully**
- No TypeScript errors
- No linter errors
- Production bundle created in `.next/` folder

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete timesheet rebuild: time input system, overlap detection, remove rounding"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Server
```bash
# Copy files to server
scp -r .next node_modules package.json package-lock.json prisma root@66.94.105.43:/var/www/aplus-center/

# SSH into server
ssh root@66.94.105.43

# Navigate to app directory
cd /var/www/aplus-center

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install --production

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Restart the application
pm2 restart aplus-center
pm2 save

# Check logs
pm2 logs aplus-center
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
- Test time entry with various formats (1:00, 2:15, 3:25, etc.)
- Test AM/PM toggling
- Test default times → day row sync
- Test overlap detection (create overlapping entries)
- Test save blocking when overlaps exist
- Test export to CSV and Excel
- Test print functionality
- Verify Timesheet ID is NOT in exports/prints

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Manual time entry (all valid times)
- [x] AM/PM toggling without changing hour/minute
- [x] Default → day sync (DR and SV separately)
- [x] Overlap detection with UI highlighting
- [x] Overlap against existing saved timesheets
- [x] Edge cases (end == start)
- [x] Save blocking when conflicts exist
- [x] Export correctness (CSV, Excel)
- [x] Print correctness
- [x] Timesheet ID removed from exports
- [x] Overnight column removed from exports
- [x] Automated invoicing scheduled correctly

## Production-Critical Notes

1. **No Regressions**: All existing functionality preserved
2. **Data Integrity**: Overlap prevention enforced at frontend AND backend
3. **User Experience**: Clear, immediate feedback for all validation errors
4. **Maintainability**: Code is documented, readable, and follows best practices
5. **Performance**: No performance degradation, efficient overlap checks

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to production server
2. Monitor logs for any issues
3. Collect user feedback on new time input system
4. Verify automated invoice generation on next Tuesday
