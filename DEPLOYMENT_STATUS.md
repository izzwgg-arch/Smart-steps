# Deployment Status - Automatic Invoice Generation

## ✅ Build Status: SUCCESS

**Build Completed**: Successfully
**Date**: $(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")

### Build Results
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: **PASSED**
- ✅ Linting: **PASSED**
- ✅ Cron job initialization: **VERIFIED**
  - `[CRON] Invoice generation job scheduled: 0 7 * * 2 (America/New_York)`
  - `Cron jobs initialized`

### Warnings (Non-Critical)
- ⚠️ Some PDF library warnings (iconv-lite) - These are expected and don't affect functionality
- ⚠️ Dynamic server usage warnings - Expected for API routes
- ⚠️ One page needs Suspense boundary (reset-password) - Not related to invoice generation

## 📋 Next Steps for Production

### 1. Set Environment Variables
**REQUIRED**: Set `DATABASE_URL` in your production environment

```bash
# Example (adjust for your database)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database"
```

### 2. Run Database Migration
Once `DATABASE_URL` is set, run:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

This will add the required fields:
- `TimesheetEntry.invoiced` (Boolean)
- `TimesheetEntry.overnight` (Boolean)
- `Timesheet.status` includes 'LOCKED'
- `Timesheet.lockedAt` (DateTime?)
- `Timesheet.timezone` (String)

### 3. Start Application
```bash
npm start
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
Check logs for:
```
[CRON] Initializing cron jobs...
[CRON] Invoice generation job scheduled: 0 7 * * 2 (America/New_York)
Cron jobs initialized
✅ Server initialization complete: Cron jobs started
```

## ✅ What's Working

- ✅ All code compiled successfully
- ✅ Cron job configuration loaded
- ✅ Invoice generation logic ready
- ✅ All components built
- ✅ TypeScript types validated

## ⚠️ What Needs Configuration

- ⚠️ `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (required for database operations)
- ⚠️ Database migration (required before first run)

## 🎯 Deployment Checklist

- [x] Code built successfully
- [x] Cron job initialized
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` environment variable set
- [ ] Database migration run (`npx prisma db push`)
- [ ] Application started in production
- [ ] Manual invoice generation tested
- [ ] First automatic run monitored (Tuesday 7:00 AM ET)

## 📊 Current Status

**Code**: ✅ Ready
**Build**: ✅ Complete
**Database**: ⚠️ Needs migration (requires DATABASE_URL)
**Cron Job**: ✅ Configured and ready

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

Once you set `DATABASE_URL` and run the migration, the system is ready for production use.

**Next Automatic Run**: Next Tuesday at 7:00 AM ET (America/New_York)
