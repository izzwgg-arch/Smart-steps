- `lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions
- `lib/dateUtils.ts` - Date/time utilities
- `.env` - Environment variables (on server: `/var/www/aplus-center/.env`)
- `package.json` - Dependencies (all installed)

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with database credentials
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npm run create-admin
npm run dev
```

### Server Deployment
The application is deployed at `/var/www/aplus-center` on the server.

To deploy updates:
1. Build locally: `npm run build`
2. Copy files to server
3. On server: `cd /var/www/aplus-center && npm install && npx prisma generate && npm run build && pm2 restart aplus-center`

### Database Migrations
Currently using `prisma db push` for development. For production, consider using `prisma migrate` for versioned migrations.

## Important Notes

1. **Permissions**: Admin-only features are protected at both UI and API levels. Check `session.user.role === 'ADMIN'` before allowing access.

2. **Timesheet Workflow**: Only DRAFT timesheets can be edited/deleted. Submitted timesheets can only be approved/rejected by admins.

3. **Invoice Workflow**: Only DRAFT invoices can be deleted. Once sent, invoices should use versioning for changes.

4. **Password Rules**: Enforced via `validatePassword()` in `lib/utils.ts`:
   - 10-15 characters
   - 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 special character

5. **Rate Changes**: Insurance rate changes don't affect existing invoices (rate is stored at invoice creation time in InvoiceEntry).

6. **Scheduled Jobs**: Need to set up cron jobs for automatic invoice generation (Friday 4 PM ET).

7. **Timezone**: Application uses `America/New_York` timezone for scheduling. Store timestamps in UTC.

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. **Start with Automatic Invoice Generation** - This is a core feature and relatively straightforward to implement
2. **Build Analytics Dashboard** - Visual analytics is important for business intelligence
3. **Implement Reports** - PDF/Excel generation is needed for compliance
4. **Add User Management** - Needed for production deployment
5. **Audit Logs & Notifications** - Important for tracking and awareness

## Questions to Consider

- Do we need email notifications in addition to in-app?
- Should we add real-time updates (WebSockets) or is polling sufficient?
- What format should PDF reports follow? Any specific templates?
- Are there additional validation rules needed for timesheet entries?
- Should we add bulk operations (bulk approve timesheets, etc.)?

## Code Style & Patterns

- Use TypeScript for all files
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- Use Prisma for all database operations
- Use toast notifications (react-hot-toast) for user feedback
- Follow existing component structure patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Maintain consistent error handling patterns

## Testing Recommendations

While not explicitly requested, consider:
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for API routes
- E2E tests for critical workflows (timesheet creation, invoice generation)

---

**Last Updated**: Current session
**Codebase Status**: ~70% complete, core functionality working
**Production Ready**: Partial - core features work, but missing scheduled jobs, analytics, and reports

Continue development with focus on the high-priority items listed above. The foundation is solid and well-structured, making it straightforward to add new features following existing patterns.
