  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  roleId      String
  section     String   // e.g., "quickAccess.users", "sections.pendingApprovals"

  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  
  role        Role     @relation(fields: [roleId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  
  @@unique([roleId, section])
}
```

### Updated Model: `Role`
- Added relation: `dashboardVisibility RoleDashboardVisibility[]`

### Migration Required:
Run `npx prisma migrate dev` or `npx prisma db push` to apply schema changes.

## 3. Dashboard Layout Reordering ✅

### Changes:
- **Quick Access section** is now the **FIRST** section at the top
- **Dashboard Stats** (Pending Approvals, Recent Activity, Recent Invoices) moved **BELOW** Quick Access
- Layout automatically adjusts when sections are hidden based on role permissions

### Files Modified:
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Reordered sections, Quick Access first
- `components/dashboard/DashboardStats.tsx` - Added visibility props to conditionally render sections

---

## 4. Header Simplification ✅

### Changes:
- Removed all navigation items except:
  - **Home** button (routes to Dashboard)
  - **Notifications** button
  - **Sign Out** button
- Maintained mobile responsiveness

### Files Modified:
- `components/DashboardNav.tsx` - Simplified to only show Home, Notifications, Sign Out

---

## 5. Role-Based Dashboard Visibility ✅

### Quick Access Tiles (Controlled via Permissions):
- Users
- Analytics
- Timesheet
- Providers
- Invoices
- BCBAs
- Clients
- Reports
- Insurance

### Dashboard Sections (Controlled via RoleDashboardVisibility):
- Pending Approvals (`sections.pendingApprovals`)
- Recent Activity (`sections.recentActivity`)
- Recent Invoices (`sections.recentInvoices`)

### Implementation:
- **Quick Access tiles** use existing `dashboard.{section}` permissions via `RolePermission.canView`
- **Dashboard sections** use new `RoleDashboardVisibility` model
- Admin and SUPER_ADMIN always see all sections
- Custom roles default to all sections OFF (Admin must enable)
- USER role retains current default access

### Files Modified:
- `components/roles/RoleForm.tsx` - Added dashboard visibility toggles for sections
- `app/api/roles/route.ts` - Save dashboard visibility on role creation
- `app/api/roles/[id]/route.ts` - Update dashboard visibility on role edit
- `app/api/roles/[id]/dashboard-visibility/route.ts` - New API endpoint to fetch visibility
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Check visibility and conditionally render sections
- `components/dashboard/DashboardStats.tsx` - Accept visibility props

---

## 6. Server-Side Route Protection ✅

### Protected Routes:
- `/providers` → Requires `dashboard.providers.canView`
- `/clients` → Requires `dashboard.clients.canView`
- `/timesheets` → Requires `dashboard.timesheets.canView`
- `/invoices` → Requires `dashboard.invoices.canView`
- `/reports` → Requires `dashboard.reports.canView`
- `/analytics` → Requires `dashboard.analytics.canView`
- `/users` → Requires `dashboard.users.canView` (Admin only)
- `/bcbas` → Requires `dashboard.bcbas.canView` (Admin only)
- `/insurance` → Requires `dashboard.insurance.canView` (Admin only)

### Implementation:
- Created `canAccessRoute()` helper in `lib/permissions.ts`
- Added route protection checks to all protected pages
- Users without access are redirected to `/dashboard?error=not-authorized`
- Admin and SUPER_ADMIN bypass all restrictions

### Files Modified:
- `lib/permissions.ts` - Added `canAccessRoute()` function
- `app/providers/page.tsx` - Added route protection

## Permissions Enforcement

### UI Level:
- Dashboard cards filtered based on `dashboard.{section}.canView` permissions
- Dashboard sections conditionally rendered based on `RoleDashboardVisibility`

### Server Level:
- Page routes check `canAccessRoute()` before rendering
- API routes maintain existing authorization checks
- Unauthorized users redirected to dashboard with error

---

## Notes

1. **Default Behavior:**
   - New custom roles have all dashboard sections OFF by default
   - Admin must explicitly enable sections for custom roles
   - USER role retains existing default permissions

2. **Admin Bypass:**
   - SUPER_ADMIN and ADMIN roles always see all sections
   - They bypass all route protection checks
   - This ensures admin functionality is never restricted

3. **Backward Compatibility:**
   - Existing USER role permissions remain unchanged
   - Existing custom roles will need dashboard visibility configured
   - No breaking changes to existing functionality

**Implementation Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for testing and deployment
