# ✅ Deployment Successful - Timesheet Visibility Permissions

## Deployment Summary

**Date:** January 7, 2025  
**Feature:** Timesheet Visibility Permissions (viewAll and viewSelectedUsers)

## What Was Deployed

### Database Changes
- ✅ `RoleTimesheetVisibility` table created
- ✅ New permissions seeded: `timesheets.viewAll` and `timesheets.viewSelectedUsers`

### Code Changes
- ✅ All timesheet API endpoints updated with visibility scope filtering
- ✅ Role management updated to handle timesheet visibility allowlist
- ✅ Role edit page UI updated with new permissions and user selector
- ✅ Timesheets list page updated with user filter (when applicable)

### Build Status
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ Prisma client generated
- ✅ Application restarted via PM2

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Database
```sql
-- Verify table exists
SELECT * FROM "RoleTimesheetVisibility" LIMIT 5;

-- Verify permissions exist
SELECT * FROM "Permission" WHERE "name" IN ('timesheets.viewAll', 'timesheets.viewSelectedUsers');
```

### 2. Test Role Permissions UI
1. Navigate to http://66.94.105.43:3000/roles
2. Click "Create New Role" or edit an existing role
3. Scroll to "Timesheets" permission group
4. Should see "Timesheet Visibility" section with:
   - "View all timesheets" checkbox
   - "View selected users' timesheets" checkbox
   - User selector (when "View selected users" is enabled)

### 3. Test View Selected Users
1. Create/edit a role
2. Enable "View selected users' timesheets"
3. Select 2-3 users in the allowlist
4. Save role
5. Assign role to a test user
6. As test user, go to `/timesheets`
7. Should see a "User" filter dropdown
8. Should only see timesheets from own user + selected users

### 4. Test View All
1. Edit a role
2. Enable "View all timesheets"
3. Assign to test user
4. As test user, should see ALL timesheets from all users

### 5. Test Default Behavior
- User with no new permissions should only see their own timesheets (existing behavior)

### 6. Test Reports
- Generate reports as user with viewSelectedUsers
- Should only include timesheets from allowed users

## Known Issues

- Build warnings about `iconv-lite` are expected (PDF generation dependency)
- Dynamic server usage warnings for API routes are expected (normal for authenticated routes)
- `/reset-password` page has a Suspense boundary warning (non-critical, doesn't affect functionality)

## Next Steps

1. Test the feature in production
2. Assign appropriate permissions to roles as needed
3. Monitor logs for any issues: `pm2 logs aplus-center`

## Rollback (if needed)

If issues occur:

```bash
cd /var/www/aplus-center
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Revert to previous commit
npm install --production
npm run build
pm2 restart aplus-center
```

**Note:** Database changes (RoleTimesheetVisibility table) will remain. To fully rollback:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "RoleTimesheetVisibility";
DELETE FROM "Permission" WHERE "name" IN ('timesheets.viewAll', 'timesheets.viewSelectedUsers');
```
